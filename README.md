# Netflix‑Style Fullstack Portfolio  
*A web application showcasing my projects, resume, and personal brand — styled in a Netflix‑inspired UI*

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Welcome to my portfolio — a fullstack web application that presents my profile in a sleek, modern interface inspired by the visual layout of Netflix.
The goal: stand out by combining strong UI/UX with solid engineering and show that I can deliver both design and code.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters  
- **Visual differentiation:** Rather than a standard static portfolio website, this delivers a dynamic, interactive experience.  
- **End‑to‑end fullstack demonstration:** From frontend UI to backend logic.
- **Tech fluency:** Highlights my proficiency in modern web development tools, component design, state management, and deployment.  
- **Recruiter‑friendly:** Easy to explore my work, navigate projects, and view my resume — all in one place.

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
Here’s what this project uses:  
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React / Vite (fast build & HMR)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility‑first styling  
- **Bundler / Dev Tools:** Vite (superior developer experience)  
- **Linting / Quality:** ESLint (config present)  
- **Deployment:** Vercel
